# Opt in Fullscreen Mode Dangit

This simple plugin prevents WordPress 5.4 from opening the block editor in full screen mode by default for new users and sessions on different devices or incognito windows _without disabling the feature altogether_.

The change was added very late in the release cycle without a proper way of changing the default setting, the suggested fix just disabled the setting entirely:
